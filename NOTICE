FIXME: that is probably not a compatible open-source license -

./taverna-perspective-myexperiment/src/main/java/org/apache/taverna/ui/perspectives/myexperiment/model/Base64.java

TODO: File claims to be public domain?

http://iharder.sourceforge.net/current/java/base64/

This is a Public Domain Java class providing very fast Base64 encoding and decoding in the form of convenience methods and input/output streams.

Also is this file really needed as Commons Codec can do Base64?
