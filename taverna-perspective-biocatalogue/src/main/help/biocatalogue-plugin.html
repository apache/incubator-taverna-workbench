    <h2>
      BioCatalogue Plugin
    </h2>
    <h3><small>Version: 0.1.1 (alpha)</small></h3>
    <p>
      The <em>BioCatalogue plugin</em> is intended to provide access to the data held 
      in the <em>BioCatalogue Web Services Registry</em> directly from <em>Taverna Workbench</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its current state the plugin is designed to:
      <ul>
        <li>display the integration capabilities with both BioCatalogue and Taverna;</li>
        <li>provide a general idea of the kinds of data that can be fetched
            from the Biocatalogue through its REST API;
        </li>
        <li>attempt to make the workflow composition process easier and provide useful
            contextual data to help with understanding of existing workflows.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      This release has made the plugin compatible with the latest version of 
      Taverna - 2.2. Several important bugs were also fixed, however more new
      functionality will be added soon.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><b>
      Please note that this is an incomplete version of the BioCatalogue plugin.
      You may see notifications that certain pieces of functionality have not been
      implemented yet; some features are not yet fully stable, which means that
      occasionally you may see unexpected error messages.
    </b></p>
    <p>
       Any <a href="./biocatalogue-plugin-feedback.html">feedback</a> will be greatly apppreciated - it
       will help to understand the true needs of the user community and develop
       a complete version of this plugin later in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version of the plugin was developed by Sergejs Aleksejevs as part of his
      final year project on the undergraduate Computer Science course at the University of Manchester.
