# Apache Taverna Workbench

Desktop UI for designing and running
[Apache Taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/) workflows.

Note that this module relies on other
[Apache Taverna modules](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/code) for
the actual workflow execution.

# Contribute

Please subscribe to and contact the
[dev@taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/community/lists#dev mailing list)
for any questions, suggestions and discussions about
Apache Taverna.

Bugs and feature plannings are tracked in the Jira
[Issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TAVERNA/component/12326814)
under the `TAVERNA` component _Taverna Workbench_. Feel free
to add an issue!

To suggest changes to this source code, feel free to raise a
[GitHub pull request](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-workbench/pulls).
Any contributions received are assumed to be covered by the [Apache License

## Disclaimer

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at the
[Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://www.apache.org/),
sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/).

[Incubation](http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Process_Description.html)
is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.



## Prerequisites

* Java 1.7 or newer (tested with OpenJDK 1.8)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) 3.2.5 or newer (older
  versions probably also work)


# Building

To build, use

    mvn clean install

This will build each module and run their tests.


## Building on Windows

If you are building on Windows, ensure you unpack this source code
to a folder with a [short path name](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1880321/why-does-the-260-character-path-length-limit-exist-in-windows) 
lenght, e.g. `C:\src` - as 
Windows has a [limitation on the total path length](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx#maxpath) 
which might otherwise
prevent this code from building successfully.


## Skipping tests

To skip the tests (these can be timeconsuming), use:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests


If you are modifying this source code independent of the
Apache Taverna project, you may not want to run the
[Rat Maven plugin](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/)
that enforces Apache headers in every source file - to disable it, try:

    mvn clean install -Drat.skip=true
